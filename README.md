The goal of this task is to explore and implement Support Vector Machines (SVM) for both linear and non-linear binary classification using Scikit-learn. You'll learn about the margin maximization principle, the kernel trick, and hyperparameter tuning using real-world datasets.


Train SVM models:

With Linear Kernel

With RBF Kernel

Visualize decision boundaries using 2D data (for better understanding).

Tune hyperparameters:

C 

gamma 

Use Cross-Validation to evaluate model performance.



We used the Breast Cancer Dataset from Kaggle. This dataset is ideal for binary classification problems.
